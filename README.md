As a passionate and highly skilled developer, I specialize in crafting seamless, high-performance websites utilizing HTML and Python. 
With a deep understanding of web architecture and backend logic, Iâ€™ve built and optimized dynamic applications that are both elegant and efficient. 
I am now expanding my programming arsenal by diving into Java to ultimately push the boundaries of what I can create across platforms and languages.
